## MOTIVATION

The idea came to me during a class where I was overwhelmed by numerous commented, uncommented, and confusing '𝘱𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘵' statements, not to mention class instances without a proper '__𝘴𝘵𝘳__' method. To solve this, I created 𝗯𝗲𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿𝗽𝗿𝗶𝗻𝘁𝘀, making debugging much easier and cleaner! Now, it's publicly available with the command: "𝘱𝘪𝘱 𝘪𝘯𝘴𝘵𝘢𝘭𝘭 𝘣𝘦𝘵𝘵𝘦𝘳𝘱𝘳𝘪𝘯𝘵𝘴"
